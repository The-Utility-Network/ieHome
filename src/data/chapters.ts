        content: [
            `**Invisible Enemies** is more than an NFT project—it is a movement. Born from the need to support U.S. military veterans who have suffered in silence due to exposure to toxic hazards during their service, Invisible Enemies uses blockchain technology to create a transparent, community-driven support system.`,
            `Our mission is to bring awareness to the "invisible enemies" that veterans face: radiation, burn pits, chemical exposure, and the bureaucratic obstacles that prevent them from receiving the care and compensation they deserve.`,
            `Through the **Zeta Reticulin Collection**, we unite a global community of supporters who believe in fighting for those who fought for us. Every holder becomes a stakeholder in a mission that transcends digital art.`,

        content: [
            `Thousands of U.S. military personnel have been exposed to toxic substances during their service—from nuclear testing sites to burn pits in deployment zones. The effects are devastating: cancer, respiratory illness, neurological damage, and death.`,
            `Yet, despite clear evidence of harm, many veterans face an uphill battle for recognition and compensation. The federal government has been slow to acknowledge the scope of the problem, leaving veterans and their families to shoulder the burden alone.`,
            `**The Nevada Test Site (NTTR)** is one of the most egregious examples. Soldiers were ordered to participate in nuclear tests with minimal protection, and decades later, the government still disputes liability.`,
            `This is the battle we fight. These are the invisible enemies we expose.`,

        content: [
            `Invisible Enemies leverages the power of NFTs and decentralized governance to create a sustainable funding mechanism for veteran support.`,
            `**How It Works:**`,
            `1. **NFT Sales**: Proceeds from the Zeta Reticulin Collection directly fund charitable initiatives. 10% of all revenue is allocated to veteran charities selected by the community.`,
            `2. **DAO Governance**: Holders vote on how treasury funds are spent, ensuring transparency and community alignment.`,
            `3. **Veterans Shark Tank**: 5% of the revenue pool supports veteran entrepreneurs, helping them build businesses and achieve financial independence.`,
            `4. **IP Rights**: Every holder owns the intellectual property of their NFT, enabling commercial use and creative expression.`,
            `By combining art, technology, and purpose, we create a self-sustaining ecosystem that puts power back into the hands of the community.`,

            `**Why 501(c)(3)?**`,

            `**The Roadmap to 501(c)(3):**`,
            `1. **Incorporate as a Nonprofit**: Establish a legal entity in a U.S. state (e.g., Nevada, Delaware).`,
            `2. **Draft Bylaws and Governance Docs**: Formalize decision-making processes, board structure, and conflict-of-interest policies.`,
            `3. **Apply for EIN**: Obtain an Employer Identification Number from the IRS.`,
            `4. **File Form 1023 or 1023-EZ**: Submit the IRS application for tax-exempt status.`,
            `5. **Maintain Compliance**: Annual Form 990 filings, public disclosure, and adherence to IRS rules.`,
            `**Timeline**: We aim to complete the 501(c)(3) application within 12 months of Phase 3 launch.`,
